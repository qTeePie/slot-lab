### 🧱 1️⃣ Two halves of Ethereum’s design

Ethereum is split into two major layers:

| Layer                    | Job                                                                | Think of it as |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Execution Layer (EL)** | runs the EVM, updates accounts and contract storage, measures gas  | “the computer” |
| **Consensus Layer (CL)** | runs Proof-of-Stake, chooses valid blocks, finalizes chain history | “the referee”  |

Your `μₘ`, `μᵢ`, stack, storage, gas, etc. all live _inside_ the execution layer.
The consensus layer just decides _which block of executions_ becomes canonical.

### ⚙️ 2️⃣ How one transaction actually flows

1. **User signs and sends tx → mempool**
   It contains: sender, recipient, gas limit, data, nonce, etc.

2. **Validator / proposer picks it up**
   When building the next block, a validator selects some pending txs.

3. **Execution layer runs each tx sequentially**

   - Loads the current _world state_ σ (balances, storage, code).
   - Sets up an empty _machine state_ μ (stack, memory, gas counter).
   - Executes opcodes one by one.
   - Updates σ if everything finishes successfully.

   When the transaction ends, μ is wiped; only σ (the global world state) persists.

4. **Consensus layer verifies and broadcasts**
   Other validators re-run those same transactions deterministically and check that the new σ hash (the state root) matches.
   If all agree → block valid → consensus achieved.

### 🧠 3️⃣ “Reset” moments in this flow

| Scope                 | Lives for                      | Reset when                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Machine state (μ)** | one EVM call                   | end of call / tx                  |
| **Global state (σ)**  | across all blocks              | never reset, only updated         |
| **Consensus view**    | the entire network’s copy of σ | updated every new finalized block |

So when you read the Yellow Paper’s “machine state μ,” it’s describing the _temporary working memory_ the EVM keeps while processing a transaction.
Once that transaction finishes, μ → gone, σ → updated.

### 🧩 4️⃣ Why the consensus layer matters to you

If you ever wonder _“who resets μ?”_ or _“who says this execution is the real one?”_ — that’s the consensus layer.
It enforces determinism: every node must get the same post-state σ from the same inputs.

That’s why the EVM is so strictly defined — every byte, gas cost, and opcode behavior has to be identical everywhere or the network would fork.

### 💬 TL;DR

> The **execution layer** = runs code and updates the world.
> The **consensus layer** = agrees which updates are real.
> Every new transaction → fresh machine state μ → run → destroy μ → save results into global σ.
